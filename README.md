This was my very first attempt at a website, as well as using Git/Github. It is very basic (and pretty slow) but it was a good learning experience.

Things I learned on this project:
    -Using version control to mitigate making extra folders for new features
    -How to deploy a site (registering domain, hosting, etc)
    -Centering Divs in CSS
    -jQuery scroll functions
    -jQuery show/hide functions
    -How to make a "sticky footer"
    -Wrangling automatic Bootstrap padding could be a full time job. Seriously. I would pay someone to do it for me.
